# Friday Reflections

Today was spent reflecting my time in code school thus far, setting 2018 career and life goals, researching and gathering coding resources to help me achieve these goals -- and some time reading and doing code challenges.

Check out my awesome goals document [here](./goals.md) for more details and inspiration on how the day went for me.
